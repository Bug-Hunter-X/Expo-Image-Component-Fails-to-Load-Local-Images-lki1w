This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a local URI that has not been correctly processed by the Expo Asset library.  The image fails to load and displays either a broken image icon or nothing at all. This is often masked by other issues, making it difficult to pinpoint.

```javascript
//Incorrect usage resulting in the error
<Image source={{ uri: 'file:///path/to/image.jpg' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```
